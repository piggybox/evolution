This is the legacy code of the multi-agent stock portfolio optimizing research prototype I did in college.

The main idea is to have multiple agents (virtual portfolio managers) keep predicting and adjusting investing strategies across multiple time frames to mimic real world processes and thus avoid the typical over-fitting problem in back testing.

Unfortunately it was written in Rails 1 and the back-end non-linear optimizer works only under Windows.
